If you use GIT you probaply know how to run a Python program.

Currently the sate is that it works but not yet a single program.
I've not even decided if the current program will stay Python (maybe .net core).
But for now this is it.
Also older version may exist in this code.
Current goal is to make it a single console program.
Yes console its ugly though i'm not a pro python dev who can make it a univeral app on any device, console will work just as fine though.
