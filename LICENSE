Medical Notice 
This software creates altered audio, it's not that loud audio helps better.
The use of this software is at your own risk, it helped me but i cannot guarantee for others.
I though have no profit goals, my only goal is to help others like me.
I hope doctors/hospitals/patients take this free software give it a try.
The effects are mostly the next day, and some time thereafter.
This time after varies per person, from days to weeks.
As a developer understanding the problem solving didn't require any medical refs.
some people are highly technical, and help others for free.
I hope you have a rgeat time dont let tinitius spoil your life!
