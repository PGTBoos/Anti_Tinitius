# Welcome to the Anti-Tinnitus Project

A breakthrough solution for tinnitus relief that I developed through personal experience and now share freely to help others.  
Essentially with this you can use your own audio device (phone or mp3 player) to cure yourself.
Let me explain how it works in simple terms:

## Understanding Tinnitus and Your Brain

Think about how you instantly recognize a friend's face in a crowd, or how you can tell when a song is off-key.  
Your brain is amazing at recognizing patterns - it's one of its core strengths.  
This same ability that helps you survive and thrive can sometimes work against you, like with tinnitus.

Tinnitus isn't a real sound - there's nothing actually making noise in your ear.  
Instead, it's your brain creating a false signal, like a computer monitor showing an error message when nothing's wrong.  
Just as your brain learned to create this unwanted signal, it can learn to stop.

## How This Software Helps

I created this software to help retrain your brain using its natural pattern recognition abilities.  
The software processes calming music in a special way:
- It adds subtle patterns that your brain naturally wants to complete
- These patterns work beneath your conscious awareness
- Over time, they help your brain realize the tinnitus signal isn't needed

It's like teaching your brain a new habit to replace an unwanted one.  
The process is gentle and works best when you're relaxed, especially before sleep.

## Using the Software

1. Select a calming MP3 file (relaxing music works best)
2. Process your chosen file using the provided scripts
3. Use regular headphones - nothing special required
4. Listen at a comfortable volume before sleep
5. Stay consistent with one song for best results

## The Treatment Process

For optimal results, follow this sequence nightly:
1. Listen to your processed song with `bandfilter-4` three times
2. Follow with one play using `bandfilter-5`
3. Go to sleep
4. Notice potential improvements upon waking

### About the Filters

**Bandfilter-4: The Foundation**
- Creates alternating left/right audio patterns
- Builds a "ladder" of frequencies around your tinnitus
- Simple enough for your brain to process, yet comprehensive in range

**Bandfilter-5: The Enhancement**
- Combines multiple proven tinnitus treatment approaches
- Used as a final step in the process
- Reinforces the effects of Bandfilter-4

## Customization

The default settings target common "TV static" tinnitus (around 10,000Hz).
It's just that my tinititus was in that range (and a lot people have it in this range).
But you can adjust parameters to match your specific frequency.  
Share your successful modifications by creating a "thanks" issue!

## Medical Considerations

- This is a complementary approach, not a replacement for medical care
- Consult your healthcare provider about integrating this tool
- The software applies safe audio filters, but results vary by individual
- Consider reducing caffeine intake, which may help (based on personal experience)
- Avoid loud environments even after improvement

## Why It's Free

I believe in making healthcare solutions accessible to everyone.  
While I accept donations (details below), this will always remain free because:
1. Tinnitus affects millions - help should be available to all, in every country
2. Healthcare solutions should prioritize healing over profit
3. Open-source collaboration improves outcomes for everyone
4. I want it to be low entry, so anyone can try it
