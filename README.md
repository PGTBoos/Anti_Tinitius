# Anti_Tintitius
This project is shared as-is for educational and research purposes and self help oor for help with a doctor  
I appreciate interest and likes in the project,  

please note:
> It worked for me, but it might not work for you.  

You adjust the code and give it a song a stero mp3 and it will process that song apply effects that you mind will learn.  
Even if you dont hear the effect (they are minimal) you ears will hear it, but the conversion to the brain is a complex part.  
Its though also this part that we need to fix as tinitius is a 'false' signal the brain over responds, and should learn to ignore.  

- You will need to alter the code to change the song, it must be in mp3 format  
  The song should be calm doesnt have to be high quality audio, not wild hardrock just something calm not to exciting alike radio music not concerts.  
  dont play it loud just normally.  
- have not included the song cause that would be a copyright violation, but look it up on the internet i think the song is quite ideal for this.  
  due to how it starts, but other music will be fine to, dont we all love Klaus wunderlich ?  (from youtube kabouter wesley).  
- I dont recomend to create a music list just use one song for this that you repeatedly use. (we need to train the brain, not distract it).   

## Recipe
What worked for me is just before sleep 3 times a relaxed song filtered by bandfilter-4  
Then end it with 1 time using filter bandfilter-5  
You will notice perhaps nothing just go to bed sleep and wake up, the effect was next morning.  

### What is special about bandfilter 4
- Aplies a short beep (left/right randomly) followed by a band filter which removes that frequency from the music.  
  The lader is simple and should start 1000hz below your tinitius, so you hear a few beeps, and others you wont hear due to your tinitius  
- The ladder is a simple effect simple enough for the brain to understand while using a wide frequency range.  
- i recommend multiple evening sessions just before sleep  
- listen 3 times and finish it of with band filter 5    (so this treathment doesnt take a long time either).  

### what is special about bandfilter 5
- band filter 5 uses a mixture of filters that, are common for tinitius, its a mixture of all of them  
  I guess people normally use on of the filters in there, but in my case or idea we just use it as a finisher with the same song.  
- You dont get a direct relief it may take multiple days but you might as well wake up and notice something is missing  
  sound may be precieved sharper, your mind tryes to confirm is it gone is it not, .. it may take some time.  

###  and the other band filters ?
- those were my other attempts, my early reasonings of what this code should do

### do you have more filters planned ?
- Yes i have, but some are a bit complex if you like this distro rate me a star and I add more, if no one uses this i wont develop more either.  
- I have a few different ideas that i could still develop for other tinitius types broad sound other frequencies  


### I am a doctor and want to contact you

## Can i alter settings, my Tinitius is at a different Hz frequency
- sure you can, its now optimized for people with the TV tinitius around 10000Hz, you can alter the code let me know what worked for you raise a thanks issue with your settings.  

## Disclaimer
I am not a doctor, just a random guy who can code.  
- I dont see any medical risks in this code, but please inform your doctor that you have tinitius as well  
- your doctor wont understand code, i do, this code is just some bandfilters over a music song upon certain frequencies  
- I review issues and pull requests but i dont have the time to answer 100ths of people.  
- For immediate assistance, consult a healthcare professional.  
- I may not respond to individual queries or feature requests.  
- Contributions are welcome, but please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting.  

# Free but i'm open for donations.
In my opinion healthcare costs enough allready, and i dont want to be a quack that gains over other people's injusries by creating expensive devices or software.  
I see how it goes with diabetics and i dont like  such money schemes at all with pattents on insuline etc.  
Never the less if this helped you, you feel relieved and want to support my futhure development of this i'm open for that.

# Why did i create this and put it online for free?
First of all to threaten my tinitius, ( i asume it might come back or variate so i'm probaply not 100% cured yet, but today feels great).  
Seccond just the other day i red someone killed herself because the tinitius was to much, i feel sad about that, i wish people will find relieve with this.  

# Profesional contact:

### I am a doctor and want to contact you
- First of all your free to use it for your patients, but you may not sell it, its free you may donate me
- raise a git issue and start the headline with `Doctor:` 

### I am a suplier of medical devices and want to make money with you
- I'm not such a quack, shame on you! i know this industry but all people need is a mp3 player and some code which i grant for free.
- Notice also this code is original and uses a mit license, i reject any takedowns of this code this is my creation not yours.
- *no we dont do it for the money*, in that case contribute to the code instead.
